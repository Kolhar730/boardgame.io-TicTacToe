# TicTacToe game using Boardgame.io

Boardgame.io [here](https://github.com/google/boardgame.io) is the reason why this repository now exists. Very much excited on building this classic game with some twists and additional features. I'm really excited about this, like you hadn't realised by now! :P

### Game Modes

* Human v Human
* Human v AI (Courtesy of Boardgame.io)

## Plan of Action

- [ ] Enable Tic Tac Toe above mentioned Game Modes.
- [ ] Make the **MONSTER** Tic Tac Toe Game and enable the same game modes mentioned above.
- [ ] Seek as much help you can to make this all possible along the way.
